# Relation Extraction

Relation Extraction (RE) is the procedure used to detect the relations between various entities in (unstructured/unlabelled) texts. RE is a very actively researched field and there have been a lot of very interesting papers and promising algorithms proposed in the recent years along with a multitude of high quality datasets. 

This repository's goal is to provide as clear an overview as possible of the research conducted in the last few years.
